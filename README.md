A few intermediate-length programs

### Overview

1. wta_1_lz78
- **C**
- Consists of encode and decode programs
- Takes any input, text, binary, or image, and compresses it using LZ78 algorithm
- LZ78 algorithm used in gzip, influenced PNG, DEFLATE, ZIP, GIF

2. wta_2_py_image
- **Python**
- Consists of encode.py, decode.py programs
- Takes PNG, JPG, or other image input and converts into a .wta file output
- Fairly slow: would not recommend using on large images

3. wta_3_processing_rts
- **Java / Processing**
- Contains Win64 and OS X Application files
- .PDE files can either be opened in Processing IDE, or renamed to .txt files to be viewed individually
- Entire program/code is processed into one readable .java file at: *Sept-20/wta_3_processing_rts/application.macosx/source/wta_3_processing_rts.java*
- I haven't touched this in a while, but it's an interesting demo of how much you can do in Processing with <1000 lines of code
