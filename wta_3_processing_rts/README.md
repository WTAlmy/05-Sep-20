Notes:
- Processing IDE optimal for running/viewing, however:
- All .pde files can be renamed to .txt files to be viewed outside of Processing IDE
- Complete .java file, including code from all 6 .pde files combined, viewable in application.platform/source/

How to run / build:
- 1. Simply running executable should work, OR
- 2. Open up .java file from above in an IDE, install Processing library
- 3. Install Processing IDE, rename wta_3_processing_rts folder to wta_RTS_demo, open demo.pde

Controls:
- "r" to regenerate map from Perlin noise
- Use the keys "1" and "2" to spawn Red or Blue tanks *while hovering mouse over that team's captured base*
- Click and drag on spawned tanks to draw a path for them to move along
- Units move slower on water / forest tiles compared to grass
- Move units onto a base tile to capture them
- Income depends on how many bases you have captured
